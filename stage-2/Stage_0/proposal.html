        <h2>Problem description</h2>
        <p>Youtube is one of the greatest free environments for learning. It has a vast source of eLearning communities, and video makers that product content related to just about everything. But at the same time, this vast wide ocean of information is not accessible in the way it is organized and it is often time cumbersome to find out a video thatâ€™ll interest you. This is especially a problem when you do not know the type of videos you are searching for, and you are simply looking for videos that will capture your attention. You have also limited the type and kinds of videos you have already scene - meaning the youtube algorithm does not give good recommendations regarding new topics or video makers one might be interested in based on their watch history.</p>
        <p>There is no structural forum we can access that has all the youtube channels, playlists, videos organized in a manner that can help one find previously unheard videos that interest them. The maximum attempt at solving this problem has been to create many articles that suggest content creators and channels follow for various topics.
